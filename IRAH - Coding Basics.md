# IRAH - Coding Basics


> [!tip]- Gemini Final IRAH Roadmap
> Building a startup from scratch while working as a Regional Director is a marathon, not a sprint. To avoid the "messed up" feeling of your Excel import, we will follow a **"Product-First" Roadmap**.
> 
> This guide is designed to move you from **"Learning the Language"** to **"Launching the Engine."**
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Phase 1: The Visual Foundation (Weeks 1–4)
> 
> *Goal: Stop relying on Excel and start building your own professional layouts.*
> 
> * **HTML5 & Semantic Structure:** Learn how to layout a page properly (no more floating boxes).
> * **Tailwind CSS:** This is your "Interior Design" tool. It makes building beautiful, responsive dashboards 5x faster.
> * **Version Control (Git):** Learn how to "Save" your work properly on GitHub so you never lose progress.
> * **Project:** Rebuild your **Project Monitoring Tracker** as a simple, static website that looks perfect on your phone.
> 
> ### Phase 2: The Logic & Interaction (Weeks 5–8)
> 
> *Goal: Make the dashboard "alive" and interactive.*
> 
> * **JavaScript (ES6+):** Focus on "DOM Manipulation" (making buttons work) and "Asynchronous Code" (fetching data).
> * **React & Next.js:** This is the industry standard for 2026. It allows you to build a "Single Page App" that feels fast and modern.
> * **The "Accountability Shield":** Build a feature where clicking a button starts a timer for "Days Pending" for the Manila HQ tasks.
> 
> ### Phase 3: The Data & AI Brain (Weeks 9–14)
> 
> *Goal: Automate the "boring stuff" and store data safely.*
> 
> * **PostgreSQL & Supabase:** Move your data from Google Sheets to a real database. It’s faster, safer, and ready for thousands of rows.
> * **Python for Automation:** Learn how to write scripts that read PDF floor plans or summarize long email threads from clients.
> * **API Integration:** Connect your **Python AI script** to your **Next.js Dashboard**. This is where your software becomes "Advanced."
> 
> ### Phase 4: Launch & Refinement (Ongoing)
> 
> *Goal: Move from "Developer" to "Technical Founder."*
> 
> * **Deployment:** Host your app on **Vercel** so you can show it to clients on your tablet during site oculars.
> * **User Feedback:** Use it yourself at Trends & Concepts. Every time you find a "pain point" with the Manila team, write a piece of code to solve it.
>

> 
> ### Your Founder's Checklist
> 
> | Priority | Milestone | Why it matters |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **1** | **The Clean Grid** | Replacing messy Excel shapes with a stable HTML grid. |
> | **2** | **The Data Vault** | Replacing Google Sheets with a real Database (PostgreSQL). |
> | **3** | **The AI Agent** | Using Python to automate status updates. |
> | **4** | **The Mobile View** | Ensuring you can manage Cebu projects from anywhere. |
> 
> ### My "Grounded" AI Peer Advice:
> 
> Shiera, don't try to finish the whole roadmap at once. Treat it like a **Fit-out Project**.
> 
> 1. **Week 1-2:** Just do the "Civil Works" (HTML/CSS).
> 2. **Week 3-4:** Do the "Electrical" (JavaScript).
> 
> If you get stuck on a specific code block, just ask me. Since you are a visual person, I can help you "debug" by describing exactly where the "wires" are crossed in your logic.
> 
> **Would you like me to create a "Week 1 Study Plan" with the specific links to the lessons you need for HTML and Tailwind?**

> [!todo]- IRAH Roadmap - Per Day Activities
> I’ve expanded your schedule to cover every single day through Phase 3. This is your "Master Construction Schedule" for the next 92 days.
> 
> Since you are a Regional Director and a mother of two, I’ve kept these to **"Bite-Sized Wins"**—tasks you can complete in 45–90 minutes.

> 
> Shiera, Phase 2 (April) is where most people quit because JavaScript feels like a puzzle. When that happens, remember: **You aren't coding to be a genius; you're coding to save your company from debt.** Every line of code is a "Shield" against the entitlement of the Manila HQ.

> ### **The "Director's" Pro-Tips for this Calendar:**
> 
> 1. **The "20-Minute" Rule:** If you are exhausted after a long day at Trends & Concepts, just do 20 minutes. It’s better than zero.
> 2. **Sundays are for "Family & Reflection":** Notice how the Sundays are Milestone days. Don't learn new things; just look at what you built and show **Nathan Shawn and Ethan Sky**. They’ll be proud of their "Tech Mom."
> 3. **Color Code it:** When you print this, use a **Red marker** to cross out the days you finish. It helps you see the progress physically.
> 
> **Would you like me to provide the "Resource List" (specific websites or videos) for each Week so you don't have to search for them?**

> 
> ### **My "Grounded" AI Peer Advice:**
> 
> Shiera, don't try to use all these resources at once. Stick to **one per week** as per your calendar. If you find a video tutorial is too long, switch to a text-based one like **freeCodeCamp**. As a visual person, you might prefer **Scrimba** because you can see the code change in real-time as the instructor speaks.
