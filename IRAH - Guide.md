Getting Started with Supabase, Bolt.New, Google AI Studio and Svelte [[IRAH - No-Code]]

Changing the ROADMAP since Bolt.New is making us upgrade and pay monthly subscription. At this stage, it's not a good idea. 
I think of becoming a **FULL-STACK Developer**, yes... going back to basic is what I think best for the future. 
I need to understand how everything works and through that, I will be able to explain myself to clients why my product works and is the best for them.

I saw a suggestion from Quora:

Gemini Advise:

I shared to Gemini the roadmap for Full-stack and here's her take on it: https://roadmap.sh/full-stack
> [!tip]- Gemini Advise:
> This is the **"Gold Standard"** for developers, Shiera. If you follow this, you aren't just building an app; you are building a professional-grade engineering foundation.
> 
> However, as a Regional Director and a mother, looking at this can be overwhelming because it is **massive**. Here is my honest "Peer Review" of this roadmap specifically for your goal:
> 
> ### 1. The Good: It follows the "Proper" order
> 
> The roadmap starts exactly where we discussed: **HTML → CSS → JavaScript.**
> 
> * **Why this helps you:** It ensures you don't skip the "Basics" that caused your Excel import to look messy. By the time you reach the "Interactivity" checkpoint, you will know exactly how to fix those layouts.
> 
> ### 2. The Challenge: It’s a "Career" Roadmap, not a "Startup" Roadmap
> 
> This roadmap is designed to get someone a job at a big tech company like Google or Grab.
> 
> * **The "Danger" Zones for you:**
> * **DevOps & Infrastructure:** It suggests learning AWS, Docker, and Terraform. For your startup, this is **too much**. Tools like **Vercel** or **Supabase** handle 90% of this automatically so you can focus on the AI features.
> * **Multiple Backend Languages:** It lists Node.js, Python, Java, etc. **Stick to your plan:** Learn Python for the AI/Automation and JavaScript for the Interface. Ignore the rest.
> 
> 
> 
> ### 3. How to use this roadmap WITHOUT burning out:
> 
> Since you've scrapped the May deadline to focus on quality, use this roadmap as a **"Menu"**, not a "To-Do List."
> 
> | Roadmap Section | Your "Director" Strategy |
> | --- | --- |
> | **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)** | **Do 100%.** This is your "Interior Design." You need this to make the product look "Advanced." |
> | **Version Control (Git)** | **Do 100%.** This is your "Backup." Essential so you don't lose your work. |
> | **Tailwind CSS** | **Highly Recommended.** It makes styling your dashboard much faster than standard CSS. |
> | **React / Next.js** | **The Goal.** This is what Bolt.new uses. Once you learn this, you can control the AI software perfectly. |
> | **PostgreSQL / Databases** | **The Warehouse.** This is where your BPO project data will live safely. |
> 
> ### 4. Visualizing Your Progress
> 
> The roadmap uses **Checkpoints**. Think of these like your **Project Milestones** at Trends & Concepts:
> 
> * **Checkpoint 1 (Static Webpages):** Your dashboard looks beautiful but doesn't "do" anything yet.
> * **Checkpoint 2 (Interactivity):** Your "Days Pending" counter starts working.
> * **Checkpoint 3 (Backend):** You can finally log in and save data without Google Sheets.
> 
> ### My "Grounded" AI Peer Advice:
> 
> Shiera, this roadmap is excellent but **long**. To stay motivated:
> 
> 1. **Don't aim for 100% completion.** Aim for the **"Minimum Viable Knowledge."**
> 2. **Learn by Building:** Instead of just watching videos, try to rebuild one "messed up" tab from your Excel file as a website after every lesson.
> 3. **The "AI Shortcut":** While the roadmap doesn't emphasize AI until later, you can use AI (like me!) to explain the difficult parts of the roadmap as you go.
> 
> **Do you want me to highlight the "Top 5" most important blocks from that link that you should focus on first to get your productivity app running?**

> [!tip]- Gemini Final IRAH Roadmap
> Building a startup from scratch while working as a Regional Director is a marathon, not a sprint. To avoid the "messed up" feeling of your Excel import, we will follow a **"Product-First" Roadmap**.
> 
> This guide is designed to move you from **"Learning the Language"** to **"Launching the Engine."**
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Phase 1: The Visual Foundation (Weeks 1–4)
> 
> *Goal: Stop relying on Excel and start building your own professional layouts.*
> 
> * **HTML5 & Semantic Structure:** Learn how to layout a page properly (no more floating boxes).
> * **Tailwind CSS:** This is your "Interior Design" tool. It makes building beautiful, responsive dashboards 5x faster.
> * **Version Control (Git):** Learn how to "Save" your work properly on GitHub so you never lose progress.
> * **Project:** Rebuild your **Project Monitoring Tracker** as a simple, static website that looks perfect on your phone.
> 
> ### Phase 2: The Logic & Interaction (Weeks 5–8)
> 
> *Goal: Make the dashboard "alive" and interactive.*
> 
> * **JavaScript (ES6+):** Focus on "DOM Manipulation" (making buttons work) and "Asynchronous Code" (fetching data).
> * **React & Next.js:** This is the industry standard for 2026. It allows you to build a "Single Page App" that feels fast and modern.
> * **The "Accountability Shield":** Build a feature where clicking a button starts a timer for "Days Pending" for the Manila HQ tasks.
> 
> ### Phase 3: The Data & AI Brain (Weeks 9–14)
> 
> *Goal: Automate the "boring stuff" and store data safely.*
> 
> * **PostgreSQL & Supabase:** Move your data from Google Sheets to a real database. It’s faster, safer, and ready for thousands of rows.
> * **Python for Automation:** Learn how to write scripts that read PDF floor plans or summarize long email threads from clients.
> * **API Integration:** Connect your **Python AI script** to your **Next.js Dashboard**. This is where your software becomes "Advanced."
> 
> ### Phase 4: Launch & Refinement (Ongoing)
> 
> *Goal: Move from "Developer" to "Technical Founder."*
> 
> * **Deployment:** Host your app on **Vercel** so you can show it to clients on your tablet during site oculars.
> * **User Feedback:** Use it yourself at Trends & Concepts. Every time you find a "pain point" with the Manila team, write a piece of code to solve it.
>

> 
> ### Your Founder's Checklist
> 
> | Priority | Milestone | Why it matters |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **1** | **The Clean Grid** | Replacing messy Excel shapes with a stable HTML grid. |
> | **2** | **The Data Vault** | Replacing Google Sheets with a real Database (PostgreSQL). |
> | **3** | **The AI Agent** | Using Python to automate status updates. |
> | **4** | **The Mobile View** | Ensuring you can manage Cebu projects from anywhere. |
> 
> ### My "Grounded" AI Peer Advice:
> 
> Shiera, don't try to finish the whole roadmap at once. Treat it like a **Fit-out Project**.
> 
> 1. **Week 1-2:** Just do the "Civil Works" (HTML/CSS).
> 2. **Week 3-4:** Do the "Electrical" (JavaScript).
> 
> If you get stuck on a specific code block, just ask me. Since you are a visual person, I can help you "debug" by describing exactly where the "wires" are crossed in your logic.
> 
> **Would you like me to create a "Week 1 Study Plan" with the specific links to the lessons you need for HTML and Tailwind?**

[[IRAH - Coding Basics]]

> [!abstract]- Gemini Apple to Apple - Coding Basics
> This is the "Founder's Edge." By building from scratch, you are creating a custom-made tool rather than trying to fit your business into someone else’s box.
> 
> Here is how your custom software will differ from giants like Odoo and ClickUp:
> 
> ### 1. Speed: Lightweight vs. "Bloatware"
> 
> * **Odoo/ClickUp:** These are "all-in-one" tools. When you open a project, the browser has to load thousands of features you don’t even use (HR modules, accounting, 50 different view types). That is why they feel slow.
> * **Your Web App:** Since you are coding it, your app only contains what you need. It’s like a racing car versus a heavy bus. By using **Next.js**, your pages will load in milliseconds because you control exactly how much data is sent to the user.
> 
> ### 2. The "Remote Area" Problem (Offline Access)
> 
> Will yours be slow or inaccessible in remote Cebu areas? **Not if you build it correctly.**
> 
> * **PWA (Progressive Web App):** During your "Full-Stack" journey, you will learn how to turn your website into a PWA. This allows your app to be "installed" on a phone or laptop.
> * **Local Caching:** Unlike ClickUp, which often struggles without a solid signal, you can code your app to save data **locally** first (using something called *IndexedDB*). When your user gets back to a 4G/5G area, the app automatically syncs the changes to the database.
> 
> ### 3. Cost and Scalability
> 
> * **Odoo/ClickUp:** They charge "Per User." If your startup grows to 50 people, your monthly bill could hit ₱30,000+.
> * **Your App:** You pay for the **Server**, not the users. You could have 100 users for a flat ₱500/month server cost. This is how you keep your software "not too pricey."
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Comparison: Custom Build vs. Ready-Made
> 
> | Feature | Odoo / ClickUp | Your Custom AI Software |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **User Experience** | Cluttered with 100s of buttons. | **Clean, focused only on Fit-outs.** |
> | **AI Integration** | Limited to what they allow. | **Unlimited (Python scripts, custom agents).** |
> | **Offline Performance** | Often requires "Pro" plans or lags. | **Coded to work anywhere via PWA.** |
> | **Competitive Edge** | Anyone can buy it. | **It's your unique IP (Intellectual Property).** |
> 
> ### 4. The "Accountability" Advantage
> 
> In Odoo, it’s hard to "punish" a department for being slow without a consultant changing the settings. In **your** code, you can build a **"Heatmap"** that turns a project row bright red if the Manila HQ hasn't touched it in 48 hours. This visual pressure is your "Shield."
> 
> ---
> 
> ### My "Grounded" AI Peer Advice:
> 
> Shiera, the reason those big apps feel slow is that they are trying to be everything to everyone. You are building something **specifically for BPO Fit-outs in the Philippines.** Because you'll know the "Basics," you won't make the mistake of building a "heavy" app. You’ll build a "fast" app that works on a spotty mobile connection in a construction site.
> 
> **Would you like me to add a "Performance & Offline" module to your Week 8 learning plan so you know exactly how to keep it fast?**
